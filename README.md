This data analysis is based on a dataset sourced from the UCI archives. I categorized the products sold into various groups and conducted detailed analyses, including RFM Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and Sales Forecasting. 
Below are the key findings:

### Basic Analysis:
**Total Revenue (Dec 2010 - Dec 2011)**: $8,278,519
**Average Order Value (AOV)**: $392,732
**Top Selling Product**: PAPER CRAFT, LITTLE BIRDIE from the stationery category
**Returns and Churn**: Negative revenue values are assumed to be returns, which contribute to an increased churn risk. The churn rate is calculated at 2.26%, though churn is not explicitly tracked for this dataset.
**Monthly Sales Trends** : Revenue saw growth in Q1, remained stable in Q2, and began to decline in Q3.
**Sales Forecasting** : Projections indicate a steady sales increase through 2012.

## Customer Segmentation:
Customers are divided into three categories based on spending behavior:

### High Spenders: Customers who spend more than $1,994.06 (top 20%).
Medium Spenders: Customers spending between $232 and $1,994.
Low Spenders: Customers in the bottom 20%, spending less than $232.50 per transaction.
The majority of the customers are Medium Spenders, with 488 classified as High Spenders.

## Summary of Churn Risk Segments:	
**High Churn Risk (RFM Score: 1-6)**:
Customers: 669
Key Point: Low engagement and high likelihood to churn. Immediate intervention needed via retention strategies.

**Medium Churn Risk (RFM Score: 7-10)**:
Customers: 20,041
Key Point: Largest group, at risk of becoming inactive. Regular engagement and monitoring can prevent churn.

**Low Churn Risk (RFM Score: 11-15)**:
Customers: 13,208
Key Point: High engagement and least likely to churn. Maintaining relationship through loyalty programs and personalized marketing will help retaining the customers.

**Key Insights**:
Customer Distribution: 59% are medium-risk, 39% are low-risk, and 2% are high-risk.
Action Plan: Re-engage high-risk customers, focus on retaining medium-risk customers, and reward low-risk customers.

**Dec 2010 Cohort:** Started with 28,013, dropping to 3,537 by month 13. Retention fluctuated but ended at 16%.
**Jan 2011 Cohort:** Began with 12,050, dropping sharply after a peak at 120%.
**Feb-May 2011 Cohorts:** Show smaller counts with varying retention rates, peaking at 183% (May) before declining.
**Late 2011 Cohorts:** Smaller sizes, with sharp declines in retention.
**Observation:** Early cohorts show better retention, while later cohorts see sharp drops, indicating a need for improved retention strategies.

**2012 Forecast:**
**Linear:** Steady increase from $382K in January to $998K in December.

**Key Trend:** Both forecasts predict growth, with seasonality accounting for expected revenue spikes in the last quarter.
